**INTRODUCTION**

In 2020, we are living in a new normal because of COVID19 pandemic. This new normal includes registering our details such as full name, mobile number and location before we enter any business premise. Thus, we want to build an app called International Research and Invention Exhibition IRIE 2020 with the aim to ease the registration process of the exhibition for both the exhibitors and visitors. With this app, the admin can process beforehand the details of the participants to ensure a smooth process during the exhibition as every organizer needs to abide by the standard operating procedure of the COVID19, which there is limitation to the number of people gathered for an exhibition.  The admin can also organize the exhibition more systematically with the details that they obtained from this app. Moreover, this app will consist of many functionalities such as authentication, registration, feedback and will be developed using react native language and firebase as the back-end.

**OBJECTIVES**
To ease the registration process of the exhibition for the exhibitors and visitors.
To help the admin organize the exhibition by obtaining participants data before the exhibitions.

**FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITIES**

As our proposed mobile application is “INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INVENTION EXHIBITION IRIE 2020”. We decided as a group to encounter a number of features and functionalities that are suitable for this type of mobile application. 
Features:
1.Flexibility: our mobile app is very flexible and simple to use apparently by two basic users such exhibitors and visitors. Moreover, the exhibitors can register by simply entering their credentials by the specified form. Thus, for exhibitors it will be an easy endeavor to reserve online the suitable slot and make sure easily they can present their poster at that exhibition. However, there is another type of form for visitors that enables them to do online registration. Consequently, it is comfortable for any visitors from different areas to save their time especially if they are coming from far away by just assuring the registration online. Lastly, it will be solving the problem of costly, complicated, inconvenient manual registration.
2.Security feature: We aim to secure our users and enable unique security that is advantageous in our mobile app. As the security can be implemented in different types through multiple ways. However, in our mobile app we enable authentication as our security method at first point by requesting from users to authenticate him/herself. So, we can make sure that who are our users either if they are visitors or exhibitors that use our mobile application to register. Additionally, if a user already registered or exists in the database, so can simply log in to authenticate who is by entering credentials. While, new users should sign up by entering their details also .
3. Feedback feature: Although, the way we allow applicants to register online but, it is an important factor to furnish them with feedback regularly. Since then, we have goals to provide them with feedback to keep awareness with our users such as confirming for them the process of registration. Although, our mobile app can ease the way for them to do registration online but without assuring the status of registration so it will be religious. So, we will furnish the applicant or participant with feedback that confirmed for them the registration if it is done or not. To illustrate, the exhibitor in this way can make sure they successfully done registration or not, so they are able to recognize or manage better preparation for posters at specified time while if not successfully register can also manage to find replacement.
 

**Functionality:**
**API**
Beside the various API that available and can be integrated in such any type of mobile app.we decided to include API notification.The reason why we choose API notification is that the most suitable to our mobile app project type specifically push notification.To ease the registration way for exhibitors and make sure their registration is fulfilled accordingly, As well as, it allows us to recognize the exhibitors who fill in the required field and register . In addition to that it will come up with various advantages on both sides such a register is confirmed. The exhibitors can confirm their poster registration which enables them to settle down the exhibition day and avoid any conflicts.

**Components**
As it is stated that react native component  is a basic part in developing any type of mobile app.Also, it is divided in two main parts such container and presentational component.Hence, in our project the basic to include container such for states,props and function for make it work eventually.Here the container role as this application will ease the way for users and exhibition visitors by allowing them to register online and include their personal information , the users can be the participants who are in favour to show their poster on that day. Thus, the application will make the ability to provide an opportunity for researchers to interact and exchange ideas and also to promote international collaborative research and give the opportunity to exhibit research outputs at global level.Furthermore, where visitors will be able to register online,our application will solve common problem that most visitors are far away from the university location and can not register on exhibition time and that not acceptable if lead them to miss that day. However, for the appearance and styling of our mobile app we can include such any type of presentational component like UI toolkit or nativebase.To be clear, for enhancement of our project we will include these components to enable our functionality and objective is working as is planned.

**Error checking:**
The error checking is an important function in determining the registration process if it can be continued successfully or not.Errors occur when people engage with user interfaces. Sometimes, they happen because users make mistakes. Sometimes, they happen because an app fails. Whatever the cause, these errors and how they are handled. Subsequently, in our project we will enable error checking that check for logic errors and unexpected app errors.For example, it will . result for user error if the details entered at wrong place,field required not filled and other logic mistakes.Error checking can assure the authentication correctly by intended users because if requested details are not entered correctly so it will give error.By this way, we will handle logic errors that encountered by users or on the app so our mobile app can be executed as intended.


**Authentication**
Basically, any platform that is designated to serve users should be entertained with security features, so the security issue is not violated. However, we decided to include one of the significant security requirements which is user authentication. Based on that, we will encounter two forms of authentication that allow exhibitors and visitors to be able do pre-registration. Also, it will authenticate users based on user situations such as new users or not. The new user needs to sign up first then proceed to do the registration online while if already the user name listed in the firebase data storage will need only to log in. As a result, we can authenticate those who are our users by enabling authentication forms that check according to data storage at firebase to able authenticate users by matching if existing or recognizing a new user.
 
**Firebase for data storage:**
  Using firebase will serve  as a database system that registers details of our users such as     applicants or visitors. So, it will store the details of users which can be useful later in the authentication and registration process. Based on that, the role of firebase to check that if the registration slots are  full or not based on database storage.Since then, the user is permitted to register through the form if there is place and then it will be listed that registered successfully.While if it is full,it will appear for the user that it is full and can not be added.Lastly, we can said that the firebase role is so useful as will help us as the data storage which result in enabling registration based on the existent places.
